Nodejs Streams !== Web Streams
The logic is similar but the way to work with each is different 

ReadableStream - Can be a file, a movie streamer, a base selected

Transform - After read the transform can change data, rename topics or any else that you want

WriteableStream - Can be a user notification, is the last pipeline event
