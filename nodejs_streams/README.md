This project was made using the Nodejs version 17.6.0

Nodejs Streams !== Web Streams
The logic is similar but the way to work with each is different

ReadableStream - Can be a file, a movie streamer, a contact base, etc

Transform - After read the transform can change data, rename topics or anything else

WriteableStream - Can be a user notification, is the last pipeline event or a server response
